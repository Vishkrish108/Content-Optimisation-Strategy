# Content-Optimisation-Strategy
Part of a hackathon for the course Data Analytics.

We had to design a model that could maximise the probability of a streaming company buying a movie, based on other movies, series, and documentaries having similar attributes.   

This model was able to achieve an R squared score of 0.88 in validation testing and 0.817 on the private leaderboard.
